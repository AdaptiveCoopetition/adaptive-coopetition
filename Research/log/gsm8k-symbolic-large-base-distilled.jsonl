{"question": "Comet Hale-Bopp orbits the sun every 50 years. Arjun's father saw the Comet when he was 20 years old. Arjun saw the comet a second time when he was four times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. How old was Arjun when he saw the Comet for the first time?", "index": 3656, "lines": ["Answer: \nLet\u2019s define variables:\n\n- Father's age when he saw the comet: 20 years.\n- Comet's orbital period: 50 years.\n- Let \\( x \\) be the number of years after the father saw the comet when Arjun saw it the second time.\n- Arjun's age when he saw it the second time: \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) years.\n\nSince the comet appears every 50 years, the time between sightings is 50 years. Therefore, Arjun saw the comet the second time 50 years after his father. \n\nWhen Arjun saw it the second time, he was 80 years old, so he was born \\( 80 - 50 = 30 \\) years after the father saw the comet.\n\nWhen the father saw the comet at age 20, Arjun was \\( 20 - 30 = -10 \\) years old, which is impossible. This indicates that the time between sightings must be more than one period.\n\nLet\u2019s assume Arjun saw the comet the second time after \\( n \\) periods, where \\( n \\) is the number of times the comet has orbited since the father saw it.\n\nThus, the time between sightings is \\( 50n \\) years. At that time, Arjun was \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) years old.\n\nSo, Arjun was born \\( 50n - 80 \\) years after the father saw the comet.\n\nThe father was 20 when he saw the comet, so he was born 20 years before the sighting. Arjun was born \\( 50n - 80 \\) years after the sighting, which must be after the father was born. Therefore, \\( 50n - 80 > -20 \\), which simplifies to \\( 50n > 60 \\) or \\( n > 1.2 \\). Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value is \\( n = 2 \\).\n\nThus, the time between sightings is \\( 50 \\times 2 = 100 \\) years. Therefore, Arjun was born \\( 100 - 80 = 20 \\) years after the father saw the comet.\n\nSo, when the father saw the comet at age 20, Arjun was born 20 years later. Therefore, Arjun was 0 years old when the father was 20.\n\nWhen the comet came again 50 years after the father saw it, Arjun was \\( 20 + 50 = 70 \\) years old, which contradicts the given condition.\n\nThis indicates that the initial assumption is incorrect, and we need to consider that Arjun saw the comet the second time after more than one period.\n\nLet\u2019s try \\( n = 3 \\). Then, the time between sightings is \\( 50 \\times 3 = 150 \\) years. Arjun was born \\( 150 - 80 = 70 \\) years after the father saw the comet.\n\nWhen the father was 20, Arjun was born 70 years later, making the father \\( 20 + 70 = 90 \\) years old when Arjun was born. This is possible, as the father would be older.\n\nWhen the comet came again 50 years after the father saw it, Arjun was \\( 70 - 50 = 20 \\) years old. This doesn\u2019t match the condition that Arjun was 80 when he saw it the second time.\n\nThis suggests that the correct value of \\( n \\) is 2, but we need to reconsider the timeline.\n\nWhen \\( n = 2 \\), the time between sightings is 100 years. Arjun was born \\( 100 - 80 = 20 \\) years after the father saw the comet.\n\nWhen the father was 20, Arjun was born 20 years later. Therefore, Arjun was 0 years old when the father was 20.\n\nWhen the comet came again 50 years after the father saw it, Arjun was \\( 20 + 50 = 70 \\) years old, which doesn\u2019t match the condition.\n\nThis indicates that the problem requires a different approach.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that Arjun saw the comet the first time when he was \\( x \\) years old, and the second time when he was \\( 4 \\times 20 = 80 \\) years old. The time between sightings is \\( 80 - x \\) years, which must be a multiple of the comet\u2019s period, 50 years.\n\nThus, \\( 80 - x = 50 \\) or \\( 80 - x = 100 \\), etc.\n\nIf \\( 80 - x = 50 \\), then \\( x = 30 \\). This means Arjun saw the comet the first time when he was 30 years old.\n\nIf \\( 80 - x = 100 \\), then \\( x = -20 \\), which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is \\( x = 30 \\).\n\nThus, Arjun was 30 years old when he saw the comet the first time.\n\nThe answer is 30."], "expected_answer": "30", "actual_answer": "30"}
