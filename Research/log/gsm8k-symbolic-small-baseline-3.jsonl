He initially has 46 bananas and buys 62 more, resulting in 108 bananas. He also buys 16 fewer kiwis than the total number of bananas he now has, which is 108 - 16 = 92 kiwis. Adding the original 5 \u00d7 46 = 230 kiwis, the total kiwis become 230 + 92 = 322. The combined total is 108 + 322 = 430.\n\nThe answer is 430."], "expected_answer": "384", "actual_answer": "430"}
