Determine how many plants can fit in the 159-meter flower bed by dividing the total length by the space per plant: 159 \u00f7 15.25 \u2248 10.426 plants. Since Xena can't have a fraction of a plant, round down to 10 plants.  \n\n(Note: Xena already owns 10 flowers, so the next step would involve checking if additional plants are needed.)", "Answer: \n3.
